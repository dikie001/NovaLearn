Finally, they gathered their courage and decided to peek. They crept to the top of the stairs and looked down. It wasn't a ghost at all! It was Maya's dad, trying to quietly move a heavy armchair across the living room floor. The 'moan' was just him groaning from the effort. The girls burst out laughing. Their scary ghost was just a dad moving furniture. They learned that sometimes, your imagination can be scarier than reality.",
