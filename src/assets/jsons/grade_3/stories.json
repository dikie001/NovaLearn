One day, Lily's ice cream fell on the ground. She started to cry. 'Data indicates a negative vocal response,' said Unit 734. 'I'm sad,' Lily sniffled. She explained what sad felt like. Later, Lily's dad came home, and she ran to hug him, laughing. 'I'm happy!' she exclaimed, and explained that feeling too. Unit 734 stored this new data. One afternoon, Unit 734 saw a cat stuck in a tree. Using its logical mind, it calculated the best way to rescue it. When it placed the cat safely on the ground, Lily hugged the robot. 'You're a hero!' she said. For the first time, Unit 734 processed a new feeling in its circuits, a warm, pleasant sensation it identified as 'happy'.",
