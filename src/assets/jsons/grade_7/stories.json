An elder from Riverbend, a man named Kenji, was already there. 'We need a bridge,' Zola said, without looking at him. 'We cannot build it alone,' Kenji replied. For the first time, the villages had to talk. There were arguments and disagreements. But slowly, they began to work. The people of Sunstone were expert stonemasons. The people of Riverbend were skilled with wood. They combined their talents. As the bridge took shape, so did a new understanding. They shared meals, stories, and laughter. When the bridge was finished, it connected more than just two pieces of land. It connected two communities who had forgotten they were neighbors.",

    "story": "It was Dad's birthday, and as usual, he said he wanted 'nothing.' But Leo was determined to get him the perfect gift. He thought about a new tie, but Dad had plenty. He thought about a book, but Dad was a slow reader. He was frustrated. How do you buy 'nothing'? He went to his dad's workshop in the garage, looking for inspiration. He saw his dad's old, worn-out workbench, covered in sawdust and paint stains. Leo spent the entire day cleaning and organizing it. He sorted the screws, hung up the tools, and sanded and re-varnished the wooden top. It looked brand new. When his dad came home, Leo led him to the garage. His dad stared at the workbench, speechless. 'Wow,' he said, running a hand over the smooth surface. 'This is... this is great, Leo. Thank you.' Leo realized he had found the perfect gift. He had given his dad a clean workspace, a few hours of his time, and a lot of love. It was the best kind of 'nothing' he could imagine.",
    "moral": "The most valuable gifts are often acts of service and time spent together."
